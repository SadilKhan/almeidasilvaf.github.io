(2007), Furlong (2013), Dempsey et al. (2013)) to the understanding of how factors interact. In such networks, nodes represent genes and a weighted link between a pair of genes is often a correlation, where the sign suggests an up- or down-regulation of one factor by another (Dam et al.</description></item></channel></rss>
