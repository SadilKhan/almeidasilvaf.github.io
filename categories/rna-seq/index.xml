Here, we characterized the soybean PR-1 (GmPR-1) gene repertoire at the sequence, structural and expression levels. We found 24 GmPR-1 genes, clustered in two phylogenetic groups. GmPR-1 genes are under strong purifying selection, particularly those that emerged by tandem duplications. GmPR-1 promoter regions are abundant in cis-regulatory elements associated with major stress-related transcription factor families, namely WRKY, ERF, HD-Zip, C2H2, NAC, and GATA.</description></item><item><title>cageminer: an R/Bioconductor package to prioritize candidate genes by integrating GWAS and gene coexpression networks</title><link>/publications/cageminer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/cageminer/</guid><description>Abstract Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is a major crop in animal feed and human nutrition, mainly for its rich protein and oil contents. The remarkable rise in soybean transcriptome studies over the past 5 years generated an enormous amount of RNA-seq data, encompassing various tissues, developmental conditions and genotypes. In this study, we have collected data from 1298 publicly available soybean transcriptome samples, processed the raw sequencing reads and mapped them to the soybean reference genome in a systematic fashion.</description></item><item><title>The state of the art in soybean transcriptomics resources and gene coexpression networks</title><link>/publications/minireview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/minireview/</guid><description>Abstract In the past decade, over 3000 samples of soybean transcriptomic data have accumulated in public repositories. Here, we review the state of the art in soybean transcriptomics, highlighting the major microarray and RNA-seq studies that investigated soybean transcriptional programs in different tissues and conditions. Further, we propose approaches for integrating such big data using gene coexpression network and outline important web resources that may facilitate soybean data acquisition and analysis, contributing to the acceleration of soybean breeding and functional genomics research.</description></item><item><title>Exploring the complexity of soybean (Glycine max) transcriptional regulation using global gene co-expression networks</title><link>/publications/globalgcn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/globalgcn/</guid><description>Abstract Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is one of the most important crops worldwide, constituting a major source of protein and edible oil. Gene co-expression networks (GCN) have been extensively used to study transcriptional regulation and evolution of genes and genomes. Here, we report a soybean GCN using 1284 publicly available RNA-Seq samples from 15 distinct tissues. We found modules that are differentially regulated in specific tissues, comprising processes such as photosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, lignin metabolism, and response to biotic stress.</description></item><item><title>Systematic analysis of 1298 RNA‐Seq samples and construction of a comprehensive soybean (*Glycine max*) expression atlas</title><link>/publications/atlas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/atlas/</guid><description>Abstract Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is a major crop in animal feed and human nutrition, mainly for its rich protein and oil contents.
