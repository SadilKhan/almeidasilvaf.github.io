The remarkable rise in soybean transcriptome studies over the past 5 years generated an enormous amount of RNA-seq data, encompassing various tissues, developmental conditions and genotypes. In this study, we have collected data from 1298 publicly available soybean transcriptome samples, processed the raw sequencing reads and mapped them to the soybean reference genome in a systematic fashion.</description></item><item><title>Systematic analysis of 1298 RNA‐Seq samples and construction of a comprehensive soybean (*Glycine max*) expression atlas</title><link>/publications/atlas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/atlas/</guid><description>Abstract Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is a major crop in animal feed and human nutrition, mainly for its rich protein and oil contents.
