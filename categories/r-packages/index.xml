For that, users must define a set of guide genes, which are known genes involved in the studied phenotype. Additionally, the mined candidates can be given a score that favor candidates that are hubs and/or transcription factors. The scores can then be used to rank and select the top n most promising genes for downstream experiments.</description></item><item><title>SoyFungiGCN</title><link>/project/soyfungigcn/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/project/soyfungigcn/</guid><description>Summary SoyFungiGCN is an R package that contains a Shiny app to let users explore a gene coexpression network inferred from RNA-seq data of soybean tissues infected with phytopathogenic fungi.</description></item><item><title>Network Analysis for Biological Data</title><link>/teaching/minipeb2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/teaching/minipeb2021/</guid><description>miniPEB 2021: Network Analysis

Network Science: Overview Network Science is broadly employed in many fields: from understanding how friends bond in a party to how animals interact; from how superheroes appear in the same comic books to how genes can be related to a specific biological process. Network analysis is especially beneficial for understanding complex systems, in all research fields.</description></item><item><title>Network Analysis for biological systems</title><link>/teaching/2ndwab/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/teaching/2ndwab/</guid><description> 2nd Workshop of Advanced Bioinformatics: Network Medicine</description></item></channel></rss>
