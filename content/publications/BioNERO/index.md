# Abstract

Summary <br /> Currently, standard network analysis workflows rely on many different packages, often requiring users to have a solid statistics and programming background. Here, we present BioNERO, an R package that aims to integrate all aspects of network analysis workflows, including expression data preprocessing, gene coexpression and regulatory network inference, functional analyses, and intra and interspecies network comparisons. The state-of-the-art methods implemented in BioNERO ensure that users can perform all analyses with a single package in a simple pipeline, without needing to learn a myriad of package-specific syntaxes. BioNERO offers a user-friendly framework that can be easily incorporated in systems biology pipelines.

Availability and implementation <br /> The package is available at Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/BioNERO).
