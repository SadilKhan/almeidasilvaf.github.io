# Abstract

Plant pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are a large group of proteins, classified in 17 families, that are induced by pathological conditions. Here, we characterized the soybean PR-1 (GmPR-1) gene repertoire at the sequence, structural and expression levels. We found 24 GmPR-1 genes, clustered in two phylogenetic groups. GmPR-1 genes are under strong purifying selection, particularly those that emerged by tandem duplications. GmPR-1 promoter regions are abundant in cis-regulatory elements associated with major stress-related transcription factor families, namely WRKY, ERF, HD-Zip, C2H2, NAC, and GATA. We observed that 23 GmPR-1 genes are induced by stress conditions or exclusively expressed upon stress. We explored 1972 transcriptome samples, including 26 stress conditions, revealing that most GmPR-1 genes are differentially expressed in a plethora of biotic and abiotic stresses. Our findings highlight stress-responsive GmPR-1 genes with potential biotechnological applications, such as the development of transgenic lines with increased resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.
