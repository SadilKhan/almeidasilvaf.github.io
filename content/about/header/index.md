<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am a Master's candidate in Plant Biotechnology at the State University of Northern Rio de Janeiro (UENF), in Brazil. I am a computational biologist interested in using and developing algorithms to study the evolution of plant genomes and gene networks. I am particularly interested in investigating how polyploidization events have shaped plant evolution, and how gene duplication can provide new material for genetic innovation in plant taxa.
