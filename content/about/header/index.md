<!-- this is a subheadline -->

I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics at Ghent University (Belgium), and I conduct my research at VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology. I am a biologist with a Master's degree in Plant Biotechnology. I am a computational biologist interested in using and developing algorithms to study the evolution of plant genomes and gene networks. I am particularly interested in investigating how polyploidization events have shaped plant evolution, and how gene duplication can provide new material for genetic innovation in plant taxa.
