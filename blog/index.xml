Since then, I’ve seen many other R developers that have faced the same issue. To help solve this problem, here I will teach you how to do some web scraping to find out the main journals where Bioc developers publish papers describing their packages.</description></item><item><title>Pushing Docker images to Docker Hub</title><link>/blog/2021-12-01-push_image_dockerhub/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021-12-01-push_image_dockerhub/</guid><description>Pushing Docker images to Docker Hub This post assumes you already have an account on Docker Hub.

Building the image To push an image to Docker Hub, you will need to have it on your machine.</description></item><item><title>Project management in bioinformatics</title><link>/blog/2021-03-01-project-management-in-bioinformatics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021-03-01-project-management-in-bioinformatics/</guid><description>Project management in bioinformatics As we advance in bioinformatics research, we develop some practices to manage our projects and handle the deadlines and productivity goals. However, these project management skills are often not taught to new students and researchers. Thus, new researchers can have very bad habits at the beginning of their projects that can be hard to fix afterwards. Here, I highlighted my list of most important management tasks for bioinformatics projects, with examples of dos and don’ts that should be incorporated in researchers’ routines.</description></item></channel></rss>
